# Turor Me
**CapsOn** 

## Introduction
The Tutor Me project is an idea that aims to provide a platform where
students that need help academically can easily find a tutor that can help them with
specific modules. This project will be useful especially now that the covid-19
pandemic has made it much difficult to have face-to-face conversations, ask for help
with their studies from fellow students, and interact with lecturers for additional
assistance. As with the rest of the world, every matter related to students is moving
towards being digital and virtual. This project focuses on providing a platform to ease
the process of:
- Registering as a Tutor that can tutor certain modules for a price,
- Registering as a Tutee that needs a tutor for certain modules,
- The tutor should be able to select the modules he/she tutors for a fee,
- The tutee should be able to choose which subject they need help with
from certain tutors,
- One-on-one chat functionality between Tutees and Tutors,
- Group chat creation for students requiring assistance with the same
modules or subjects,
- Sending and receiving notifications when Tutor is found
- Video calling functionality in-app to allow students to virtually meet
After implementing these core functionalities of this project, we would start looking at
additional functionalities like filtering tutors by gender to enable students to choose
someone that they are comfortable with. We would also look into implementing a
dark mode of the app for users that prefer it over light mode. The project will be
implemented as a cross platform mobile app for Android and iOS.
